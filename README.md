Just me exploring Python while learning more in my grad school course - BCIS 5390: Python Programming

## IDE and Textbook information
FYI - Python offers a free IDLE that is perfect for beginners!

My personal favorite is `PyCharm` which is offered by JetBrains!
* The community edition is free! https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/

For my graduate school course, I am renting a digital version of this textbook:
* *Starting Out With Python, 4th Edition* by Tony Gaddis.
* https://www.amazon.com/Starting-Out-Python-Tony-Gaddis-dp-0134444329/dp/0134444329/

## *How do I run these programs?*
* Run these programs using your terminal or command line tool.
* Type `python nameOfProgram.py` 
    * For example, `python printFavoriteThings.py`
